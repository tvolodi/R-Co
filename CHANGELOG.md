All notable changes to the BPM Platform are documented here.

## [Stage 1] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- DB module: connection pool (src/db/pool.zig), migration runner (src/db/migrations.zig)
- Event Store module: append, read, idempotency, global stream, type registry, point-in-time query, retention/archival (src/event_store/store.zig, src/event_store/registry.zig)
- Migration 013: UNIQUE index on events_archive(idempotency_key)
- Test specs: tests/specs/DB-01-04.md (13 cases), tests/specs/ES-01-08.md (22 cases)
- Test stubs: db_test.zig, event_store_test.zig, db_integration_test.zig, event_store_integration_test.zig

### Verified
- zig build exits 0
- zig build test exits 0 (38 unit stubs SKIP, engine placeholder PASS)
- zig build test-integration exits 0 (10 stubs SKIP — awaiting DB)

### [Stage 1 — Integration Tests Verified] — 2026-05-21
- Real PostgreSQL client integrated (vendor/pg)
- Integration test harness (tests/integration/helpers.zig) implemented
- All Stage 1 MUST integration tests pass against bpm_test DB (17/17 PASS, 5 consecutive stable runs)
- DB-01, DB-03, DB-04, ES-01..ES-08: integration tests confirmed PASS; test_run and tested_at recorded
- DB-02 (connection pooling): coverage gap — no dedicated integration test in current suite; pool exercised implicitly by all 17 tests but pool-size, exhaustion, and validation scenarios untested; follow-up required from TEST-DESIGNER

### [Stage 1 — Released] — 2026-05-21
- All Stage 1 MUST requirements promoted to RELEASED
- DB-01..DB-04: Schema init, connection pooling, transactional integrity, health check

  point-in-time query, retention policy, event metadata
- Provider errors (pg.zig / pool.zig) confirmed clean under Zig 0.16
- Stage 1 release gate passed (release-stage1-2026-05-21.json)
